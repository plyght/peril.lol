  pic_img: /img/reading/puglia2.jpeg
  date: 9/29/2021
  description: This is one of those books that will stay with me a long time because it gave me a new framework through which to see the world. I'm also very happy it introduced me to the phrase "heuristic reaction." I love words. I love language. I love understanding how language shapes who we are and how we move through the world together.
  highlights:
    - With words, we breathe reality into being.
    - They were raised to see the good in people, even to their own detriment.
    - In this way, it’s not desperation or mental illness that consistently suckers people into exploitative groups—instead, it’s an overabundance of optimism.

  date: 9/24/2021
  description: I'm a little embarrassed to admit that this book made me want to become a writer. Maybe it was the almost saccharine happy ending, or maybe I read it in the first place because that life already sounds romantic to me.
- title: Beautiful World, Where Are You
  url: beautiful-world
  place: in Amsterdam
  pic_img: /img/reading/amsterdam2.jpeg

  date: 9/9/2021
  description: I wasn't sure for a while, but after this I've decided I like Sally Rooney's writing. Its sparseness has a way of sucking you in. It's blunt and specific. Her pontificating is very thinly veiled, but so is a lot of literature. When she gets poetic, it's surprisingly magnetic.
  highlights:
    - The fact that we are exposed to these people everywhere in our culture, as if they are not only normal but attractive and enviable, indicates the extent of our disfiguring social disease. There is something wrong with them, and when we look at them and learn from them, something goes wrong with us.
    - What if the meaning of life on earth is not eternal progress toward some unspecified goal—the engineering and production of more and more powerful technologies, the development of more and more complex and abstruse cultural forms? What if these things just rise and recede naturally, like tides, while the meaning of life remains the same always—just to live and be with other people?

  date: 8/6/2021
  description: P. E. Moskowitz is one of my favorite journalists right now, and reading this book solidified that for me.
  highlights:
    - We don’t need to look very far back to know that free speech is a conditional freedom in this country, and that those conditions are nearly always defined by those in power.
    - If we are debating the free speech rights of people like Milo, whom are we ignoring? What about the free speech rights of the people he is recommending we deport or imprison?
    - What is and is not free speech is in the eye of the beholder.

  date: 5/25/2021
  description: Yet another funny surrealist short story collection! I'm consistent, I loved it! Each story stars a woman named Sarah, from a freshman in college, to a sex worker, to the first Sarah.
  highlights:
    - Probably he talked shit about sex workers and voted Republican, which made Sarah sad to think about because besides probably wanting all women dead, he seemed really sweet.
    - It was amazing, Sarah felt, how whole worlds existed right beside or within the world you thought you were in.

  date: 4/9/2021
  description: The more Otessa Moshfegh I read, the more I love her writing. This one didn't get as much attention as My Year of Rest and Relaxation, but I liked it more. The mystery and deeply unreliable narrator were more up my alley.
  highlights:
    - The mind must be spoken to, Vesta, otherwise it starts to atrophy. ... "But if the mind talks to itself," I said, "isn't it just saying what it wants to hear?"
- title: Luster
  url: luster

  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91h5gTluEVL.jpg
  date: 4/5/2021
  highlights:
    - His joy is raw in a way that makes me feel like I can unzip my skin suit and show him all the ooze inside. But not yet. There is a sadness about his fervor, the way it feels slightly put on, as if he has something to prove.
    - A woman so unthreatened by all of New York's women that she has given this nubile horde a wholesale blessing to fuck her husband.
    - I have come to the part of the night where I am incapable of any uppercase emotion, and every circuit responsible for my cellular regeneration has begun to smoke.

  pic_img: /img/reading/sf.jpeg
  date: 01/18/2021
  description: This put into words so much of what I've felt about the tech world. I've always observed the tech world has very little interest in the past, and this does a good job tracing back all the platitudes everyone repeats and holds.
  highlights:
    - It describes our tendency to think that the meaning of a work of art comes out of the specific mind of the creator, not out of the preexisting rules that creator worked within nor the broader spirit of society and time.
    - The genius aesthetic that rules the tech industry relies again and again on this purely gestural kind of courage, on hyping everyday things into grand acts of nonconformism and even resistance. You repeat what people around you are saying anyway and get to call yourself a freethinker.
    - The rhetoric of disruption relies on actively misunderstanding and misrepresenting the past.

  pic_img: /img/reading/old-bethpage.jpeg
  date: 08/30/2020
  description: It took me a while to read this. I finished it when I visited home to see my grandma before she passed away. The timing is appropriate, I suppose.
  highlights:
    - If you see a person crying inside a car, you know they are already held.
    - Empathy can be a hole through which one falls into despair.

  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg
  date: 06/19/2020
  description: The amount I talk about and recommend this book now is very annoying. You've been warned.
  highlights:
    - People feel they have been let in on a deep secret of the universe, and they cannot be shaken from that conviction.
    - And then there was this light, it was the pure light of love and divinity, and it was with me and no words were needed.

  date: 03/22/2020
  description: I discovered a love of prose poetry and this kicked off a phase of learning Joni Mitchell on the piano (including Blue, of course).
  highlights:
    - Do not, however, make the mistake that all desire is yearning.
    - At the bottom of the swimming pool, I watched the white winter light spangle the cloudy blue and I knew together they made God.
    - At times I fake my enthusiasm. At others, I fear I am incapable of communicating the depth of it.

  date: 03/20/2020
  description: I'll be honest, I started the TV show and then couldn't wait for more episodes so I read the book in 2 days.
  highlights:
    - Mia realized that she was crossing into a place she would have to go alone.
    - A lifetime of practical and comfortable considerations settled atop the spark inside her like a thick, heavy blanket.

  date: 03/17/2020
  description: I really liked Tolentino's essays, but I almost already agreed with them so much that I found reading this kind of boring?
  highlights:
    - Writing is either a way to shed my self-delusions or a way to develop them. A well-practiced, conclusive narrative is usually a dubious one.
- title: Maybe You Should Talk To Someone

  date: 02/13/2020
  description: I'd recommend this to anyone considering therapy but feeling apprehensive about it.
  highlights:
    - Maybe happiness is sometimes.
    - Instead of leaning into the goodness that comes their way, they become hypervigilant, always waiting for something to go wrong.
- title: Homesick For Another World
  url: home-sick-for-another-world
  place: at Matching Half
  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LqR8BogoL.jpg
  date: 01/24/2020
  description: I started this a few years ago and I finally picked it back up and finished it. I think I didn't get Moshfegh's writing at first, but after I read My Year Of Rest And Relaxation I understood her work better. It's brutally honest and darkly funny (...like many books on here)
  highlights:
    - I hated my boyfriend but I liked the neighborhood.

  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91X4ZCruKNL.jpg
  date: 11/17/2019
  highlights:
    - Judaism had taught her to keep running, no matter who tried to hold her hostage. It had taught her to create her own opportunities, to turn rock into water and water to blood. It had taught her that such things were possible.
    - Something is pulling her back to the person she’s been all along.
- title: In The Dream House

  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zeicdP-gL.jpg
  date: 11/06/2019
  description: Carmen Maria Machado is my favorite author right now and I was so excited
    to read this memoir. She puts words to the felt but unspoken like no other. She
    brings to light how unproductive archetypes of traumatic experiences can be, and
    how the subtleties of the less extreme ones can fall through the cracks.
  highlights:
    - I toss the stone of my story into a vast crevice; measure the emptiness by its small sound.
    - The nature of archival silence is that certain people's narratives and their nuances are swallowed by history; we see only what pokes through because it is sufficiently salacious for the majority to pay attention.
- title: How To Do Nothing
  url: how-to-do-nothing
  place: at The Panhandle
  book_img: https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net/?resize_to=width&src=https%3A%2F%2Fartsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2FJKrqKfh6_jbE0yciUKrUeQ%252FHTDN%2Bfinal.jpg&width=1200&quality=80
  pic_img: img/reading/panhandle.jpeg
  date: 11/03/2019
  description: This crystalized so many things I've been feeling and thinking lately.
    What I actually have to say about this book needs much more than a little blurb
    here. This presents a reframing on our lives today that we'd all benefit from
    reflecting on. It also inspired me to start learning the trees around San Francisco,
    particularly at the park I mostly read this book in.
  highlights:
    - Yet we inhabit a culture that privileges novelty and growth over the cyclical and the regenerative. Our very idea of productivity is premised on the idea of producing something new, whereas we do not tend to see maintenance and care as productive in the same way.
- title: 'Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber'
  url: super-pumped
  place: at Home
  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sXxANtN9L.jpg
  date: 09/12/2019
  highlights:
    - It is the story of the ugly decisions made around user data and personal information as technology firms seek to exploit consumer data. But most of all, it is a story about how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly wrong, and a cautionary tale that ends in spectacular disaster.
- title: Normal People
  url: normal-people
  place: in Portland, OR
  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wD4yYUqyL.jpg
  date: 09/18/2019
  description: This was a really sweet, easy read.
  highlights: Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very
    far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out
    where it was and become part of it.
- title: Severance
  url: severance

  book_img: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81A9dFqIEEL.jpg
  pic_img: img/reading/seattle.jpeg
  date: 09/01/2019
  description: This is a story about the apocalypse, but it is much more a story about
    our routines and how they form us.
  highlights: To live in a city is to live the life that it was built for, to adapt
    to its schedule and rhythms, to move within the transit layout made for you during
    the morning and evening rush, winding through the crowds of fellow commuters.
    To live in a city is to consume its offerings. To eat at its restaurants. To drink
    at its bars. To shop at its stores. To pay its sales taxes. To give a dollar to
    its homeless.

  date: 07/03/2019
  description: This made me appreciate good government even more than I already do.
    It was also horrifying for that same reason.
  highlights:
    - We don’t really celebrate the accomplishments of government employees. They exist in our society to take the blame.

  description: This is one of many form-bending absurdist short story collections
    I've read lately and I'm happy to be continuing the phase.
  highlights:
    - The things that are the most important aren't shared; they are important to only us.

  description: Sometimes all you can do is bare witness.
  highlights:
    - I am weary of all our sad stories—not hearing them, but that we have these stories to tell, that there are so many.

  description: This is the funniest book I've read in such a long time. I thought
    it was actually really loving towards men and it was a good reminder that dating
    is supposed to be fun. I loved her point about how easy it is for women to fall
    into supporting a partner, and how important it is to forge your own path and
    focus on your own art.
  highlights:
    - 'Whatever happens will happen, but the pay is certain: you''ll always be able to write, or talk, or paint, or knit (why do people knit??) about it. You can make it into something beautiful or hilarious or genius or so incredibly dumb that it''s hilarious and genius.'

  date: 05/27/2019
  description: This book is about a woman who basically takes a butt load of drugs
    and fucks off for a year. It's from her point of view, so as you can imagine,
    this was incredibly depressing, and made me feel kind of insane. But I must have
    liked it because I plowed through it in one day, and it was actually weirdly funny.
  highlights:
    - Rejection, I have found, can be the only antidote to delusion.

  description: Still reading this one, but already loving how poetic science can be.
    In a weird way, it talks about  some of the same themes that Her Body And Other

  highlights:

  description: I love this one so much I've been rereading it. I'm forced me to grapple
    with the absurdity of what it feels like to move through the world as myself,
    and it resonates in a way that can only be felt. The way form and structure are
    twisted delights me over and over again. It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind
    in the best way. We live in an illogical world and trying to make sense of it
    is what makes us crazy.
  highlights:
    - I took a step toward her. “It is my right to reside in my own mind. It is my right,” I said.

  description: This story makes my whole chest hurt.
  highlights:
    - And so we stood together like that, at the top of that field for whatseemed like ages, not saying anything, just holding each other, while the windkept blowing and blowing at us, tugging our clothes, and for a moment, it seemed like we were holding onto each other because that was the only way to stop us from being swept away into the night.

  description: I like this book so much that I have trouble getting through it. Every
    sentence feels like a whole universe that I want to soak up and live in. I think
    a lot about how the stories we tell shape our lives and Rebecca Solnit says it
    more beautifully than I ever could.
  highlights:
    - Stories are compasses and architecture, we navigate by them, we build our sanctuaries and our prisons out of them, and to be without a story is to be lost in the vastness of a world that spreads in all directions like arctic tundra or sea ice.

  description: I read a bunch of Vonnegut a few years ago when I had a long commute
    into Brooklyn, and somehow missed this one. His books are always easy for me to
    pick up when I'm not in the mood to read anything else.
  highlights:
    - The on button simply started a flight from Mars. The off button was connected to nothing. It was installed at the insistence of Martian mental-health experts, who said that human beings were always happier with machinery they thought they could turn off.

  description: I should have read this years ago, but I'm glad I finally did.
  highlights:
    - Everybody gossips, so if you are going to gossip about your friends, at least make it fun and interesting. As a corollary, never say “I never lie” or “I never gossip” because you are lying.

An earthy, minimal Ghostty theme with soft pastel vibes 🍵

================
File: matcha/repomix-output.txt
================
This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.
Generated by Repomix on: 2024-11-24T23:58:42.875Z

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

            <p class="project_text"> Next, it deals with motion, using a system that reinforces the timing and hierarchy. The most important words simply appear, and the connecting words slide into frame on cue. Lastly, the atmosphere of the song is considered using a system of dynamic background color. The colors change according to the swells and dips of the song. The same colors are used repeatedly to give the viewer a sense of the song's form. An entirely different system is used for the bridge, which uses a different form and instrumentation, and therefore calls for a new, more commanding visual.</p>

            <p class="project_text col4">Anonymous Was A Woman is challenging the biases we all have about women in history. It is based on the quote by Virgina Woolf, “I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.” Given an accomplishment or quote without a source, we often assume it should be attributed to a man. The campagin argues that this is a disservice to both human history and women today.</p>
            <!-- <h3 class="project_subhead">Call to Action</h3> -->
            <p class="project_text col4">Anonymous Was A Woman is targeting educated adults who would not think of themselves as having this bias, but still do. Anonymous Was A Woman’s name comes from an often shared shortened version of the Virginia Woolf quote: “For most of history, anonymous was a woman.” The name succinctly summarizes the purpose of the campaign.</p>

Their forgotten nature renders them anonymous. In the  rst panel, the redaction bars and silhouette set up the neutral mood. The only information the viewer is given is the masculine sounding accomplishment. In the second panel, the bars are removed and the silhouette is  lled in, revealing that the accomplishment belongs to a woman.</p>
            <p class="project_text col4">In context, the pairs would never appear directly next to each other. This is to adequately time the reveal and make sure the meaning is felt.

# Background
I designed a typeface for my Typography 3 class at Northeastern University. We were tasked with designing a typeface that could be used for body copy at 7pt. We were allowed a lot of freedom in what we wanted our typeface to be.

After some sketching to figure out where my interests lied, I decided to design a more modern transitional serif that could work on screens.

# Naming
As the typeface came together, from capitals, to lowercase, to punctuation, to metrics, its personality formed. It started reminding me of something you'd see in a childhood scary story. I named it after my favorite character from my favorite childhood books: Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events.

            <p class="project_text col6">Different people are all taking their own photos, some may never see the light of day. With Blurr, if you're in the same place at the same time, you'll be able to see all the photos taken around you. During a session, the app pulls in the photos of other Blurr users being taken in the radius you set. After you end a session, the photos are available to be viewed and saved for 24 hours.</p>

However, we were also balancing concerns about privacy and low numbers of users for the MVP. We originally presented the Blurr team a few options that solved some of the privacy concerns we had, like creating sessions, or only letting Facebook friends see your photos. The Blurr team wanted as many photos as possible accessible in the first version of the app to combat the low number of users at the start. In the end, we landed on a solution that opened the experience up to as many users as possible.</p>

This session continues in the background, pulling in photos around you and compiling them into a feed, which you can sort between all photos, your Facebook friends, and your own photos. When you're done, you can end your session, and the photos are available from the start screen for 24 hours.</p>

# Background
A team of four students (Emily O'Brien, Evan McEldowney, Alice Young and Beatrice Huang) and I set out to explore the question: How might we create a memorable and accessible experience for novice visitors that creates interest and conversation between visitors and the museum itself?

### How might we...
- bridge the gap between physical and digital?
- support different interests of different visitors?
- support flexible decision making?
- create emotional/personal connections between museum goers and artifacts?
- add context to the content?
- encourage sharing?

# Audience
Based on academic papers we sourced, we identified our main audience as low-involvement museum visitors. We broke those people down into a few different segments.

1. **First time visitors**—Tourist, New local
1. **Repeat visitors**—Student, Experience seeker, Recharger, Specialist
1. **Facilitator**—Parent/Child, Teacher/Student

{:.full}
![](/img/full/museum8.png)






# Brainstorming
First, we filled out empathy maps for three audiences: Museum Goers, Curators and Museum Owners. A big takeaway from this exercise is that we needed to understand the museum’s perspective more.

After, we brainstormed problem statements. We picked out the problems we were most interested in and put them into buckets: How might we give visitors the confidence to not understand everything? How might we give visitors a tailored, meaningful experience? How might we measure our effectiveness?

Using these prompts, we brainstormed quick ideas for solutions. Looking back, a lot of our ideas from this brainstorming session made their way into our MVP.

![Museum logos](/img/full/museum5.png)
###### The museums in the Boston area that we spoke with.

# Professional interviews
Based on our exercise, we realized we needed to understand the museum's point of view more, so we set up interviews with professionals who worked with or at these organizations. These interviews were to empathize with a new audience, but we were also looking to potentially partner with a museum to execute the project.

At this point in our process, we were considering many avenues for a final product and deciding whether we wanted to partner with a local museum, use a space at Northeastern, or create a pop-up museum that explored our ideas. We decided to pursue a partnership because we thought that although we would need to deal with museum bureaucracy, it would give us the best opportunity to deal with space and a large collection of work. We were originally most interested in the MFA due to its proximity, traditional space, large collection, and it was a good example of the problems we identified.

{:.full}
![Sitemap](/img/full/museum6.png)
###### An early sitemap of the final app


# Proof of concept

After we knew the MFA wouldn’t be a viable partnership, we decided to pursue a mobile app. By working with this platform instead of working with large screens or installations, we will not need to worry about our work becoming rapidly obsolete, and our solution can easily extend to other museums. Additionally, our work can be easily created and implemented, allowing us to quickly learn from feedback and create improvements. Over about 3 weeks, we established the information architecture, sketched wireframes and started preliminary designs.

# Working with Harvard Art Museums
About halfway through the project, we met with the Harvard Art Museums and decided to move forward with using <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api">their open API</a> and designing the experience around their space.

{:.full}
![App screens](/img/full/museum7.png)

# Implementation
Once we decided on this direction, we designed the prototype iteratively based on in-person testing at the museum itself. Some ideas we explored in this phase included:

**Beacon technology** — We explored placing beacons in the space to power experiences like letting users explore art near them in place


**Color based tours** — Using the Harvard Art Museums' robust API, we could use their data to make unique kinds of tours.


**Creating your own tours** — By simply letting users select from a list of works on view, then ordering those by room, we could easily create custom tours.

**Audio-based experience** — Utilizing the beacon technology, we also began exploring voice and music based experiences that wouldn't require looking at your phone.

# Impact

In the end, we hope the project can be an example to institutions what is possible when a robust, thoughtful API is available. The project won the Humanities & Arts award at [Northeastern’s Research, Innovation, and Science Exposition (RISE)](https://www.northeastern.edu/rise/).

The different sections we thought we would need changed over and over again, but the bulk of the website is for consumers to purchase the candles, or to sign up for a membership to be sent candles on a schedule. We spent a long time estabishing and making sure there was a clear hierarchy and navigation. We were sure to design responsively for tablet and mobile in addition to desktop. The website is not finalized, so what you see here is still missing some images, and includes some placeholder images and text.</p>

            <p class="project_text col4">We decided to implement editing section by section, so that we could iterate and use what we were designing before implementing it globally. We started with the Links section.I investigated the WordPress backend and listed out all of the data that needed to be edited or added:</p>

            <h3 class="project_subhead">Explorations</h3>
            <p class="project_text">I first experimented with a modal style, but we thought it would be more intuitive and less time consuming if the editing could take place in context. We also decided to simplify and automate this information, which cut the data input down to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Link URL (string)</li>
                <li>Link Name (string)</li>

            <p class="project_text">I then explored creating an “Edit Mode,” that mimics the interface itself and lets you quickly edit in context. The colors invert, letting the user know they are in a different mode. The user can then click on an icon to expand the edit fields, which then automatically save.</p>

            <p class="project_text ">I worked with the developer on the project to implement this, then worked on applying it to the roster. This added an extra layer of information, since the user needed to be able to add a team, and then add people to that team. To deal with this, I experimented with how to edit the team name, and how to create a hierarchy between adding a team vs adding a person. Editing a person simply followed the patterns that I established with the links section.

# A Grown Up's Guide to Reading
## A collection of advice I frequently give about reading

---

I’ve had a really common reading experience as a lot of people. I was, as they say, a voracious reader as a kid. Then, somewhere along the way, I kind of just stopped. Maybe high school turned reading into homework, or maybe I was so busy in college that it became hard to keep up with. But either way, I found myself still holding onto this identity as “a reader” without having read a book, especially one outside of The Canon[^1], in years.

I still probably don’t read as much as it might seem, but I’ve found a much happier, more productive[^2] relationship to reading and I think that all starts with my first reminder:


## Reading is fun
The reason I read a lot as a kid was very simple: ​*it was fun*. I wasn’t doing it to Learn for the sake of it necessarily. I wasn’t doing it to fulfill my identity as a Reader.  I did it for the reason most kids do things: I had fun doing it.

Life doesn’t need to be so serious all the time. There are a lot of reasons to read. Sometimes it’s to grow, sometimes it’s to learn about something, sometimes it’s to make sure I still have a semblance of an attention span, sometimes it’s to get my mind off things, sometimes it’s to laugh. I grow from being silly and having fun just as much as I do from being serious. And reading doesn’t always need to be about growing, it can also just be dumb. There are bad books just as much as there’s bad TV, but sometimes something dumb is fun and that’s what we need at that moment.

The people I know who read the most are the ones who take it the least seriously. They aren’t the I Set A Goal To Read 100 Books In A Year ones. They read a lot because it’s a way they like to spend their time.


## Don’t feel guilty dropping books
This is probably the biggest thing that got me reading more. As soon as reading something becomes a chore ​**stop reading it**​. Whenever I have the thought *"maybe I should read tonight"* and I feel a pit in my stomach, I stop reading that book.

*But isn’t it worth pushing through that? Don’t some books get better?* Maybe that’s true! But you won’t get to that point if you dread reading the book. Maybe a different you will find the book again in the future and want to give it another go. Maybe that you will be you next week, but the you right now really doesn’t wanna be reading that book. Save reading difficult-to-get-through books for when you have some good reading momentum.

I am often in the middle of multiple books at a time. I’ll read one book when I need something lighter, and read another when I feel like digging into something meatier. There are no rules! You don’t have to finish a book before moving on to the next one on your list. You don’t have to read one book at a time. You don’t *have* to do anything, because your life isn’t English class.


## Fiction is good for your soul
I read a pretty even mix of fiction and nonfiction, but I’ve met a lot of other grown-ups who never read fiction and that makes me very sad. When I ask why they often say that fiction feels frivolous or that they should be using that time to learn about something.

Allow me to give you my quick, very earnest, pitch about fiction if you need to hear it.

Nonfiction might help you learn about a topic, but fiction helps you learn about life! The human condition! I dunno, your own soul! I learn so much more through fiction, and if that’s surprising to you, you need to expand your definition of learning. Stories put words to the mysterious, the things you thought couldn’t be made concrete, the felt but not seen. Stories pull water from the mist in the air.

I am a more empathetic person because I read fiction. I’m a good storyteller because I read fiction. I know myself on a deeper level because I read fiction. I understand the world better because I read fiction. I’m more in touch with my imagination because I read fiction. Fiction helps me understand how much perspective can change a narrative, which is a skill we could all use these days.

If you don’t read fiction, here’s your nudge to try it. I feel a little silly even talking about fiction like this because it’s such a huge genre. I fully believe everyone can find something they like. Yes, even as a grown-up.[^3]


## Take notes, but not too seriously
This one you can take or leave, but I like to read with a pen. I feel like it helps me pay attention as I’m reading, it helps me read a little deeper, and it helps me come back to things that stuck out, made me feel something, made me laugh, was a particularly beautiful turn of phrase, the list goes on and on. Honestly, my most frequent note is probably “lol.” It doesn’t need to be that deep. Yes, I physically destroy my books with this. It’s fine. They’re not library books. If you don’t want to use a pen, use a highlighter, use post its, use the highlighter on your kindle. Just try it and see if it helps you. If it feels like a chore, or it's taking too much work, forget it! I’m not the boss of you! [^4]



## Independent bookstores have _great_ book recommendations
It can be hard to break out of The Canon if that’s what you’re used to, but independent bookstores are genuinely an amazing way to find new books. This is the second biggest thing that got me out of my reading rut.

Walk into any independent bookstore where you live and there will probably be a Staff Picks shelf.[^5] Or a Bestsellers shelf. And probably plenty of other fun sections that speak to you. My favorite stores have personally written notecards with their favorite books. Plus, there are really lovely people there whose whole job is to talk to you about books. The books you’ll find will be interesting, different, often contemporary books that weren’t written decades ago by a dead white guy. They will be books that speak to our lives today, and books that stretch your idea of what a good book can be. Maybe you’ll get exposed to short story collections[^6], poetry, or graphic novels.

If you don’t live near a bookstore, a lot of places will post recommendations on their site or in their email newsletters.

If you live in NYC or SF (sorry I’m a coastal elitist), or you don’t live near an independent bookstore, here are some quick plugs of my favorites, and links to their online recommendations.

## There are no rules
If there’s anything I hope you take away it's this. Read on a Kindle. Read physical books. Read on both depending on your mood. Listen to audiobooks. Read four books at a time. Who cares! Do what feels right to you and find books that make you fall in love with reading.

---

[^1]: Books you might get assigned in a high school English class, for example.
[^2]: Productive here defined simply as: I read more!
[^3]: YA is still fun as an adult too.
[^4]: I like to share my messy hardcopies with friends and have this romantic notion that it's as if they're reading the book along with me. My friends disagree and find my "lol"s very distracting.
[^5]: If you’re lucky, the Staff Picks shelf will have the bookseller’s name, and if you like something on there, you can assume you might like their other recommendations.
[^6]: I did, which mini tip: is also a great way to get out of a rut.

            <p>I'm a Product Designer at GitHub based in San Francisco. As a designer, I like hard problems, smart type, fun hover interactions, and compassionate design. As a person, I enjoy pretending I know how to play the piano, buying Moleskine notebooks that I don't need, and making self-deprecating jokes.</p>
